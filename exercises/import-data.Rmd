This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


## Ex 0 

Import packages `readr` and `readxl`    required 


## Ex 1

Read the `mpg` file in the `./data` directory. Use `;` as delimiter 


```{r}
read_delim( './data/mpg.txt', delim = ___)
```


## Ex 2

Read the `mpg` file in the `./data` directory. Use `;` as delimiter and assign column type using the `col_types` argument


```{r}
read_delim( './data/mpg.txt', delim = ___, col_types = '___________')
```



## Ex 3

Read the `iris.txt` file. You need to guess the delimiter

```{r}
read_delim( './data/iris.txt', delim = ___)
```



## Ex 4

Read the `iris.txt` file. You need to guess the delimiter

```{r}
read_delim( './data/iris.txt', delim = ___)
```

## Ex 5

Read the `tree.txt` file. You need to assign column names to:  `girth`, `height`,  `volume`  by using argument `column_names`

```{r}
read_delim( './data/trees.csv', delim = ';', col_names = ' ... ')
```

## Ex 6

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
```


### Exercise 0

Use `glimpse()` and/or `print()` to see a quick overview of the `mpg` data.

```{r}
```


### Exercise 1

Print out the `class` column using the `select()` function. 

Try using the `pull()` function instead of select to see what the difference is.

```{r}
```



### Exercise 2

Print out all but the `class`  column using the `select()` function.

```{r}
```

### Exercise 3

Print out the `manufacturer`, `model`, `displ`, `year`  columns. 

Consider using the colon `:` symbol to simplify selection of consecutive columns.

```{r}
```


### Exercise 4

Create the object `mycars` containing the columns `manufacturer`,  `model`, `displ` , `cty` and `hwy` but let the last two column names be `city_miles_per_gallon` and `highway_miles_per_gallon` respectively

```{r}
```


### Exercise 5

Create two new variables in the `mycars` data frame `city_km_per_litre` and `highway_km_per_litre` using the `mutate()` function. 
Hint: 1 mpg is 0.425 kml.

```{r}
```


### Exercise 6

Randomly select and print half the observations of `mpg`. Hint: consider using the `sample_frac()` function

```{r}
```


### Exercise 7

Print out from `mpg` rows from 10th to 15th. 
Hint: consider using the `slice()` function.

```{r}
```


### Exercise 8

Print out the `mpg` all distinct `manufacturer`.  Hint: Consider using the `distinct()` function.

```{r}
```


### Exercise 9

Print out from `mpg` object all the observations which have `cty` > 21 and manufacturer either `audi` or `jeep`

```{r}
```


### Exercise 10

Compute the average `cty` by `manufacturer`

```{r}
```


### Exercise 11
Compute the average `hwy` by `manufacturer` only for cars of class `compact` 

```{r}
```
